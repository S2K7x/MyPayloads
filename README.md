## Overview

The **MyPayloads** repository provides a well-organized collection of payloads covering various types of attacks and testing scenarios. Each payload category is tailored to specific types of vulnerabilities, including but not limited to:

- **SQL Injection**
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**
- **LFI (Local File Inclusion) & RFI (Remote File Inclusion)**
- **Command Injection**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**
- **XXE (XML External Entity Injection)**

Additional payloads will be added over time to cover more exploit types and testing methods. Each payload is accompanied by detailed explanations, syntax examples, and usage notes.

## Payload Categories

The repository is structured into directories based on vulnerability types to make it easy to locate specific payloads:

1. **SQL Injection (SQLi)**: Payloads for various SQL injection techniques, including authentication bypass, error-based, union-based, time-based, and boolean-based SQLi.
2. **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: A variety of XSS payloads for testing stored, reflected, and DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities.
3. **LFI/RFI (File Inclusions)**: Payloads for testing Local and Remote File Inclusion vulnerabilities, including directory traversal, PHP wrappers, and advanced LFI/RFI techniques.
4. **Command Injection**: Payloads for command injection and remote code execution (RCE) attacks.
5. **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**: Payloads to exploit CSRF vulnerabilities by crafting malicious requests.
6. **XXE (XML External Entity Injection)**: Payloads for XXE attacks, including external DTDs and other XML manipulation techniques.

Additional categories will be added as new payloads are developed.
